The entire bee movie script in python

### Credits
Credit to [these guys](http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/a1/bee-movie-script-transcript-seinfeld.html) for the original transcript and of course the original creators of the Bee Movie. 

#### To download just clone the repo. Nothing special.

### How to run
Make sure you have the most recent version of python. 
Open your terminal emulator of choice and run 'python3 bee.py'
I've only tested this on linux, but it _should_ work with Windows as well.
