# BeeMoviePy
The entire bee movie script in python

### Why did you make this?
I was bored. 

#### To download just clone the repo. Nothing special.

### How to run
Make sure you have the most recent version of python. 
Open your terminal emulator of choice and run 'python3 bee.py'
I've only tested this on linux, but it _should_ work with Windows as well.
